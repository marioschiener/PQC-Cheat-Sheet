# PQC Cheat Sheet(s)
A cheat sheet for the new post quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms (OK, actually multiple cheat sheets, it's just a little too much for one one page...)

The target audience are technical roles such as software developers, architects or engineers or simply anyone interested in cryptography and PQC. The cheat sheets aim to make it easier for them to select the right algorithm for their use cases, based on various different algorithm characteristics presented in a simplified form.

## Compiling
Use LuaLaTeX for compiling the .tex files (PQC-Cheat-Sheet.tex is the root document). You may need to install the provided fonts in your system first. Set the -shell-escape option in order to reconvert the *.svg graphics after any change during compilation (this requires inkscape to be installed).

(Currently, all content except for the preamble is in one document on purpose. This is to make it easier to change formatting for each page using search/replace. Once everything stands, the content will be broken down into different smaller files.)
